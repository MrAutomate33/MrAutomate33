## Step 2
The following pane will appear on the right side. Asking you to select your desired connection.
If you have one or more connections available (as shown in the screenshot below at position 1). Please select the one you want to use.<br/>
Else we need to crate your first connection with this resource type. To do that please select 'Create new' (as shown in the screenshot below at position 2).

## Step 3
A new tab will open in your browser with all your existing connections.
Select 'New connection' and look for the resource type you where configuring.
After you have created the connection, you should be able to select this one now like in [step 2](/CreateConnectionsInImport.md#step-2).

After doing this for all the necessary connections you should be able to import the Power Automate flow.
